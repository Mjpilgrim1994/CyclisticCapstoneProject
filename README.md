# CyclisticCapstoneProject
This project was completed as part of my Data Analytics Certificate program through Coursera. 
The goal was to identify the main differences between subscribers and nonsubscribers to the app Cyclistic and provide
insights on my findings to stakeholders.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **R** (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, janitor)
- **Excel** (initial exploration)

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `/data` — RCsv data files used for analysis. 
- `/scripts` — R scripts and code for cleaning, analysis, and modeling. Markdowns are included to give you a step-by-step walkthrough of my thought process.
- `/outputs` — ggplot visualizations made with R.  

## 📊 Project Overview
1. Cleaned raw data using `dplyr`, removing duplicates and standardizing column formats.
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find patterns and outliers.
3. Built visualizations to show usage behavior, and service locations.
4. Created an Rmarkdown file for a step-by-step of my work.

## 🚀 Key Insights
- Subscribers to Cyclistic tend to have shorter bike rides but have more rides throughout the year and visa versa.
- Pointed out the heavily used locations so we can make sure that those areas are always stocked with bikes.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Improved my ability to clean and visualize real-world messy datasets
- Practiced storytelling with data to make actionable business recommendations
- Better understanding on how to use R for data cleaning and visualizations
- I wanted to do this project without a guide provided by the public dataset, I found that my thought process aligned almost perfectly but through a slightly different process (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TzCqk59_J23D5zNCvwAPSgK-5osp-wVnifsc-VOpCaI/template/preview)
